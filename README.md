# AnttiHarjula_Website-project

A responsive website for small business. Created mainly for marketing purposes, showcasing the company's services and products.

The idea is to keep it kind of simple yet effective.

## Technologies used in the project

1. HTML5
2. CSS, CSS-Flexbox, CSS-Grid
3. Javascript (**IF** needed for adding some functionality, not certain about this yet...)

### Few words about the author and the workflow on this project

I'm Topi TÃ¤htinen from Finland, currently learning on my free hours outside of my job (not tech job). I have been trying hard to learn web development for a couple of years now, mostly by trying to suck knowledge from Freecodecamp.org and Codecademy.com. Also took Jonas Schmedtmann's Web Development course from Udemy.com and I'm currently working on his Javascript course. Working on a 3-shift job while building this will probably make this a bit slowpaced project since I have a limited time on my hands, but will be doing something for this on daily basis until it's done. If not actual coding then I will be thinking about possible solutions to problems, the design etc etc. This will be my first website project which I'm building using mobile-first approach so I'm convinced that some problems will be arising. Challenge accepted...
